# Collaborative Model-Based Systems Engineering
This repository provides the example SysML v2 model, which includes:
* A simplified example model that shows the basic structure of SysML v2 
* A concrete example model about measurement system that enables precise force measurement capabilities 
* One necessary sub-system of measurement system as the load cell model.  

The examples are used to show the collaboration between OEM and the supplier focused on the aspects of model development and model exchange. The collaboration process is based on the idea of the following CMBSE approach.

## How to check the model
To import and check the model, the relevant installer for eclipse plugins (KerML and SysML Editors & PlantUML visualization) or Jupyter kernel (SysML language kernel) is required. 
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The further installation guides can be found in the **SysML-v2-Release repository** [[Link](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release/tree/master)], in the _install_ dictionary.
> To visulize the textual notations of the model in the eclipse, model project **sysml.library** in the **SysML-v2-Release repository** must be installed and built with following the installation guides _(Path: install/eclipse/README.adoc)_. 

## Related Work
The model shows the implementation of the SysML-v2 model and Dataspaces in the published paper **Collaborative Model-Based Systems Engineering Using Dataspaces and SysML v2** [[Link](https://doi.org/10.3390/systems12010018)] as the contribution from Product and Systems Engineering Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technische Universität Ilmenau [[Link](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/university/departments/department-of-mechanical-engineering/profile/institutes-and-groups/engineering-design-group)].
